# Graphics_Satellite_Rescue_Simulation_Game
A Java Project


The project was a 2d game. In the game, a space station has entered the earth's atmosphere. The pilot in our shuttle, should attack the space station, before it crash lands on the earth's surface. The pilot has 5 chances in the form of five fuel cells that can be launched from the shuttle. If a fuel cell comes into contact with the space station, the space station freezes, the shuttle moves towards the space station, takes out the fuel out of the space station and returns back to its original position. The game then ends and the screen closes. Player can select different levels of difficulty as each level determines the speed at which the space station is orbiting.
